# 🔁 Exploring LangGraph: Agentic Workflows with Python

Welcome to my AI experiments with **LangGraph** — a Python framework for building **stateful, multi-step, and agent-like applications** powered by large language models (LLMs). This repository captures my journey in understanding and applying LangGraph to create structured, intelligent, and flexible AI workflows.

## 🌐 What is LangGraph?

[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) is an open-source Python library that lets you build **dynamic computation graphs** where each node can represent:
- a language model call,
- a tool invocation,
- a data transformation,
- or an agent decision.

It is inspired by **state machines** and **dataflow programming**, offering native support for memory, conditional logic, and complex multi-step reasoning — something traditional LLM wrappers often lack.

## 🧠 Why I'm Exploring LangGraph

I’m diving into LangGraph to:
- Move beyond single-step prompts and unlock **structured reasoning** with LLMs
- Build **modular pipelines** for agentic tasks like tool use, retrieval, and memory
- Understand how AI agents can maintain state and make informed decisions
- Experiment with **agent workflows**, chatbots, and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)

LangGraph provides a fresh way to think about AI development — focusing on flows, not just prompts.

## ✨ Key Features of LangGraph

- 🧩 **Composable Nodes**: Each step in your graph is a modular function or model call
- 🔁 **Stateful Workflows**: Easily pass memory and data between steps
- 🧠 **LLM-Aware Agents**: Design agents that can reason, plan, and interact
- 🔀 **Conditional Branching**: Control logic flow with dynamic decision-making
- 🔄 **Support for Loops & Multi-Agent Patterns**
